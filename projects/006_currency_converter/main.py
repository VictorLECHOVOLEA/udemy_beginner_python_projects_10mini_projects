Homework:
1. Right now it works fine if you insert a rate that exists, but make it so that if the user
enters a rate that doesn't exist, the program tells them that the currency is invalid, then
show them a list of all the valid currency options.
2. Edit the script so that the "to" currency can also be specified as euro. 
3. [Hard] Instead of loading the data from a local JSON file, try loading the data from an API. 
This task will require you to search online for a free API for currency exchange rates, and to make
a request to it so that you can load that data in this script.

Improvements:
when run by a user like me, encounter errors with the rates.json file because my root file folder is the 10mini_projects.
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'rates.json'

A short description of what the project is doing, what the user should expect, and how to run the project.

After the project run, I got this number which I don't understand what it means whithout looking into the code. 559.6501619481676
